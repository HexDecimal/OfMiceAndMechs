  * coal centered society
  * everybody does exactly as told
* values:
  * authority
  * efficiency
    * surpassing quotas
    * no punishment for failure
    * upranking for surpassing quotas

# world background story:

* dark times (from the beginning till 18th century)
  * humanity evolved
  * humanity did human stuff
  * old Kingdoms and nation states existed were aggressively colonizing
* the big war (15 years)
  * basically the word war but with more steam engines
  * the germans won dominance in this war converting to a strict dictatorship
  * germany colonized the rest of the world and assimilated all allies
* the golden times (350 years)
  * creation (30 years):
    * germany stopped to exist as an nation state and grew to a world dictatorship under the imperator
    * german aristocracy, rich people and higher lever party members grew to become the leading cast
    * basically everybody else was the lower cast
    * the dictatorship fought internal enemies and did dictatorship things
    * society was streamlined to the imperators goals and unrest was eliminated
    * introduction of the implant and strict birth control
  * duration (320 years):
    * rare appearance of mad scientists due to the implant
    * after realizing, that the imperator gets old and will die, various longevity treatments were build for the imperator trough mad scientists
    * the upper cast got genetically and otherwise engineered and modified to gain positive attributes
    * the lower cast got genetically and otherwise engineered to be loyal and stupid
    * degeneration of society to a construct for the imperators wishes
    * no development except very limited peaks ordered to be done by the imperator
  * say("""	computers were never developed outside of mad science
    * the dictatorship had no external enemies and no relevant internal unrest
    * the imperator had to disappear completely for yearlong longevity treatments and enforced his wishes by the implant and delegating most of the work to his underlings
    * seeing his death as an possibility, the imperator decided that a new imperator may be crowned after his death by consensus of his highest underlings
    * if no big Plans were obstructed the imperator allowed conflicting orders or disagreements between same ranged to escalate into small wars, the imperator was also fond of "live practices" of new tech and tactics
  * the end of the hierarchy (1 minute):
    * the imperator was awake very rarely and no external or internal threads were feared
    * the highest of the upper class gathered in Berlin, placed with a lot of distance but in the same city
    * the whole city and everything within 50km was glassed during the awakening of the imperator
    * most of the facilities and cities in core germany were heavily damaged
    * details are unknown, but it is assumed that the heavily mad science based life chamber had a defect and exploded
    * the top of the hierarchy was killed
      * imperator and direct replacements
      * the whole leadership of core-germany unto regional level
      * the whole central government
    * the remains of the hierarchy started about at the governor position of the old colonies and provinces
    * the hierarchy was split in 21 "branches" without a living superordinate
* now (since ~500 years)
  * from time to time especially in the beginning there were tries to crown a new imperator but all failed because no consensus on whom could be reached
  * each of the "branches" had to survive as an independent hierarchy
  * 12 of the original branches collapsed completely or were reduced to tiny warbands
  * the 9 remaining branches are the de facto new states of the earth, but all follow the last orders received
  * since most order lost any meaning by now every branch operates with a basic set of common old rules by the imperator and a few last orders concerning only the specific branch
  * without new orders the states degenerated further and changed into a singe objective state overfullfilling the last order
  * mad scientist appear more regularly with a few additional glassings
  * larger areas and cities are unmaintained
  * pirates, monsters and warbands appear
  * the new hierarchies constantly run out of specific resources and steal from and fight wars against each other

## abstracted story:

the gain and loss of absolute power

## rough story:

* tutorial phase with simulation restarts
  * restarts on fixed point with heavy handholding and scripting
  * risk: loss of live
  * risk: restart at tutorial
  * risk: low initial ranking
    * -> get comfortable with game mechanics and do what you are told
* spawn as officer
  * allow class selection based on results of previous runs
  * actual play the game and order your minions to achieve overwhelming (scripted) tasks
  * let specific NPCs grow to the players heart
  * pro: getting your brain transplanted to a new body if it can be recovered and you are valuable enough
  * pro: get a brain transplants when injured very heavy and valuable
  * risk: getting permakilled on death with repeated bad performance
  * risk: loss of gamestate on death
  * risk: loss of NPCs
  * risk: game progress without the player being able to watch/influence
  * -> climb the hierarchy and become the faction leader
* faction leader
  * manage your colony and be efficient at what you do
  * wage war against the other factions and risk loss of position
  * pro: get a brain transplant at every medic station
  * pro: get a brain sync by an incredible expensive process
  * risk: reduced to spawn as officer on death
  * risk: loss of gamestate on death
  * risk: relocation on death with brainsync
  * -> follow the last Orders until realizing that there is a way to restore the old hierarchy by getting elected as the new imperator
* rise to imperator
  * gain control over other factions and gain factual immortality
  * eliminate the other hierarchies or convince the other faction leaders to vote for you
  * pro: get a brain transplant to special engineered bodies
  * pro: get enough brain syncs to use it for fast travel
  * -> get crowned to imperator
* imperator
  * implant rot gets triggered by the crowning process
  * since all elements in the upper caste have implants everybody is affected by implant rot
  * active implant rot makes people unresponsive or mad scientists
  * prepared disasters should trigger:
    * bioweapons release by mad scientists
    * unstable facilities burning down by unresponsive leaders
    * mechs failing because of unresponsive base personal
    * lower caste increasingly regain sentience and revolts
    * pirates and sentient lower caste members unaffected by link rot take over idle resources
    * mad scientist taking over more and more infrastructure and proceeding to produce dangerous things
  * implant rot triggers faster and faster to kill the player
  * higher destruction rate should result in more aggressive environment
  * player is killed despite the brain syncs and transplants because of mad scientists killing everybody and glassing facilities
    * pro: you control everybody and everything for some time
    * pro: execution + permadeath after death with GAME WON screen :-)


# save system:

* simulation restart = gamestate is kept, character is ported back to engine room. minor details are discarded, all quests reset
  * dying with low status and never having had a high status
* spawn as officer  = get woken up from sensory deprivation tank, get ceremony for achieving Manhood 8 Birthday. Details of world are discarded
  * dying with having had a high status once
  * dying without being recovered
* brain recovery = time gets forwarded
  * dying with brain recovery
* synced brain = restart at last sync station
  * dying while having sync implant
* permadead = the whole world and gamestate gets killed
  * dying while fugitive or vat duty
  * treason
* execution because of danger to the current hegemony = permadead with credit screen
* Vat duty = gamestate is kept completely

pull lever
*engine roaring*
stand to attention

killing mice -> hunter -> tunnel cleaning
killing invaders -> soldier -> military education
temporary command -> planning -> logistics

dying or failing -> simulation restart


watch

[
boiler bursts
temporary
]
```

### Vat duty (tutorial2):

```
follow orders till

good mechanic -> Machine room
