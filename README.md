## the aim of this game

OfMiceAndMechs aims to be about adventures exploring hierachies in a living complex world.

This means you should be able to walk around and kill enemies and do quests. On your quests you should explore a vast map and have companions that walk, fight and die with you.

The NPCs and the player should give each other commands and quests and sometimes complete a big quest together. If you do good, you should get a promotion and underlings to boss around.

These quests should usually not be player focused, but generated from the world and should have an impact on the world. A hardcoded story wouldn't hurt either, so things don't get too boring.

## state of the game

A lot of work has been sunk into this project. Currently i'd estimate the game to be 25% done.
A lot of things are still missing. I did get simple playable version to try out.
That way i got some player feedback, which resulted in masive changes an lot of ploishing.
I'm pretty proud of it by now and think i may reach demo this year.

Check the website for downloads, more in depth information and texts.
But most important:

Try the game and send me some feedback!
