## the aim of this game

OfMiceAndMechs aims to be about adventures exploring hierachies in a living complex world.

This means you should be able to walk around and kill enemies and do quests. On your quests you should explore a vast map and have companions that walk, fight and die with you.

The NPCs and the player should give each other commands and quests and sometimes complete a big quest together. If you do good, you should get a promotion and underlings to boss around.

These quests should usually not be player focused, but generated from the world and should have an impact on the world. A hardcoded story wouldn't hurt either, so things don't get too boring.

## state of the game

While there has been a lot of work sunk into this project, i'm still working on piecing a prototype together and i'm nowhere near a complete game. 
My goal is to get it into a state, where i can release a demo this year.

The main game can be started by running executeMe.py or executeMe.exe and pressing "new game" "play now" with your mouse.
The main game is pretty chaotic and confusing right now, so i'm currently working on toning things down and make them more understandable.

There are more modes available, that are gameplay experiments of some sorts and can be accessed by starting the game and selecting "start specific scenario".
